# Nigeria House Price Prediction

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook for predicting house prices in Nigeria. The notebook implements various machine learning algorithms, including K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Naive Bayes, and Support Vector Machines (SVM) for classification. The goal of this project is to analyze the given dataset and build models to predict whether a house price is above or below the median price.

## Project Overview

In this project, the Nigeria House Price Prediction.ipynb notebook explores and preprocesses the house price dataset. It then builds and evaluates different classification models, including KNN, Naive Bayes, and SVM, to predict whether a house price is above or below the median price. The project aims to provide insights into the factors influencing house prices in Nigeria and develop accurate prediction models.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is provided as `nigeria_houses_data.csv`. It contains information about house features, such as the number of bathrooms, bedrooms, toilets, and parking spaces, along with the corresponding house prices. The notebook preprocesses the dataset by transforming the features and splitting the dataset into training and testing sets.

## Repository Structure
